=================================================

The free and collaborative 360° street view of the world.

Roadmap
-------

- Rename the project in a non confusing name (not linked to OSM, GSV)
- Separate the project into the frontend JS, the backend data server, and the website
- Prepare the data processing taking as input 360° pictures, a GPS track, an optional orientation data file, and attach the images to the OpenStreetMap data, ready to be viewed.
- Starting to take contributions manually
- Prepare a rig, and have fun mapping part of Paris
- Set up a StorJ instance (or other tech) in order to scale data storage in a non-profit environment (part of donations redirected to hard drive contributors)
